Project Proposal
___

We are analyzing data surrounding NFL players and the crimes they are arrested and/or convicted for. Thus far, we’ve found substantial amounts of data (both CSV’s and API’s) including arrest data classified by arrest type, player position, disposition, date of arrest, player’s team, and more. 

Potential questions or areas of focus/interest so far:
	Player position versus crime type (stacked bar)
	Total crimes committed per team versus total wins over past 20 years (scatter)
Distribution of crime type (pie)
Geographical distribution of crime occurrence frequency (map)
Potential relationships between individual player’s popularity and arrest frequency

Task allocation:
Chad is Excel wizard and the power pointer
We all feel fairly confident with Pandas and MatPlotLib

Anticipated Challenges:
Merging
Cleaning 
Cleaning in order to merge 
Using google api for any kind of mapping construction
